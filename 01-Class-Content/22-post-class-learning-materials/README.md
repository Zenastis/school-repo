# Post Class Learning Materials

## Overview 

This module is meant to give students some direction following the completion of class. It is suggested that you continue to code everyday for *at least* 30 minutes.  Unfortunately, some students fail to reinforce their coding knowledge and, inevitably, they forget what they worked so hard to learn.  See the question "What are some suggested projects to build following boot camp?" below for ideas on what to code next.  

The main feature of this module is the inclusion of a unit meant to introduce you to the fundamental concepts and terminology of computer science. The intent is to provide you with just enough exposure to contextualize technical interview questions and enable further study.

Also, included in this module are a study guide -- containing a brief overview of each unit -- and a comprehension check/quiz -- containing multiple high-level questions pertaining to each unit.  Feel free to use these documents to make your own (more detailed) study guide or flash cards!  

Hopefully, these resources give you a jump start into coding after the boot camp, enjoy the rest of your adventure!

## Course Resources
* You will maintain access to BCS indefinitely, course material in GitLab for approximately three months, and your course Slack workspace for approximately 4 - 6 weeks, after boot camp ends. 
* We recommend saving specific links, material and resources as Slack restricts access to old conversations in workspaces. Clone the repository to your machine
